## Troubleshooting

| Problem                 | Solution                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| "Query is required"     | Type something in the input box            |
| "Failed to parse query" | Check your internet, try again             |
| No results found        | Try a simpler query (e.g., just "VP")      |
| Wrong results           | Switch to Advanced tab for precise control |

## That's It!

The AI search handles job titles, locations, industries, company sizes, and keywords automatically.
Just describe who you want to find! üéØ
